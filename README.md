# ML-Classifiers-Comparison
Overview
This repository contains an extensive comparison of different machine learning classifiers applied to multiple datasets. The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of several classifiers (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression) on various datasets, focusing on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project also includes visualizations to help uncover patterns and insights from the models' performance.

Datasets
Autism Dataset: Predicts autism spectrum disorder based on various diagnostic features.
Fertility Dataset: Classifies fertility levels based on health attributes.
Liver Disease Dataset: Predicts liver disease based on medical parameters.

Classifiers:
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression

Each classifier was evaluated using three different data splits:
80/20 (80% Training, 20% Testing)
50/50 (50% Training, 50% Testing)
20/80 (20% Training, 80% Testing)

Additionally, the classifiers were assessed using the following performance metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Train/Test Accuracy
Visualizations
